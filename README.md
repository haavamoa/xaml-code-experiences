# xaml-code-experiences
A collection of experiences during my days of Xamarin and WPF.

The idea is that I want to use this repository as a lookup when facing different scenarios while developing a Xaml based application. I would also like to share it with the world! :earth_americas:

> Note: This is mainly written for Wpf, but the principles can be used while developing with Xamarin.Forms as well.
